/*
Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented into
a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. For example, given s =
"leetcode", dict = ["leet", "code"]. Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as
"leet code".

 If we use native approach it exceeds the time limit. Best solution is to use dynamic programming...
